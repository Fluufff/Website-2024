Please make sure to take a moment to read this before registering:</p>\r\n<p>1)&nbsp; You can buy one or more residential tickets for you and your friends, this includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>üõå A spot at the hotel from the 9th to 13th of November.</li>\r\n<li>ü•û Breakfast.</li>\r\n<li>üéü The convention ticket</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There is an exception to this, this year we offer Triple and Quadruple bedrooms. As they are in limited numbers, you can only take the full bedroom (which are all inclusive too: breakfast and convention ticket for the people in the bedroom).</p>\r\n<p>2) Reserving individual residential tickets, and not rooms, means you do not select a room yourself.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, you can create a group through your profile.</p>\r\n<p>To share a room with someone, you have to be in the same group and the group has to be complete (for example for a Triple bedroom, a group is full when there are three roommates in the group).</p>\r\n<p>3) Payment methods, installments and deadlines.</p>\r\n<p>We accept card payments (Credit, Debit, and Bancontact) and bank transfer.</p>\r\n<p>Card payment is due 10 days after finishing the booking process.</p>\r\n<p>Using bank transfers, we allow up to 3 installments that must be completed within 2 months after finishing the booking process.</p>\r\n<p>However, a down payment of at least &euro;120,00 is required within 10 days! In both cases, should you miss this 10 day deadline, your spot can not be guaranteed, and can be canceled to be made available to the next person on the waiting list!</p>\r\n<p>4) Account creation is already available, so feel free to give yourself a head-start and prepare your account and save some time! üëèüëèüëè</p>",
