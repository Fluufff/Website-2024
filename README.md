This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Copy `.env` to `.env.local` and fill it in (see [`tools/mockoon-fake-api`](tools/mockoon-fake-api/) to set up a local mock API).

Then run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
