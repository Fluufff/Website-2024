The furry fandom is mainly about creativity and is also known as a very social community.\n\nMost furries create their own character (also called fursona), based upon a certain animal. There are normal animals, hybrids, mythical creatures and some even create their own species.\n\nIf there’s a meetup or a convention, you could find some people wearing fursuits. These fursuits are mostly costumes based upon someone’s fursona. The fursuiters not only provide a hug, but also want to put a smile on the faces of children and adults alike.\n\nIn the community and during conventions, it is all about making art, writing stories, roleplaying, socializing, and also making and wearing fursuits.

This means we wish to be as permissive as possible, as long as this does not cause offence among other attendees and people who share the public spaces. Exceptions to the rules below will be clearly communicated as well as the specific hours and areas to which they apply.\nBe aware that some items of clothing, apparel, or similar items might bring the convention and/or fandom into disrepute and should not be worn in public. If you have to ask or think twice about doing something in public, it is a good indication that you should take it to your room.\nConvention staff reserves the right to determine whether any clothing and/or accessories contravene the following rules.

This means: You will need to have a valid convention ticket, and thus paid in full, by the time we will make the room sketch.\n#### Approval\n\nOnce you have been approved you will be sent an email notifying you. \nIf you were approved, and your table wasn’t claimed within 2 weeks, you can email the Dealers Den team (dealers.den@fluufff.org) and request to be placed on the waiting list; you are not directly eligible for a new table.\n\nIf you are placed on the waiting list, you will be added to the bottom of the list. If we reach you again, you will have 2 weeks to accept this one via a reply. If you fail to claim that table - you will not be added to the waiting list for that year/edition/convention again.\n### What we look for in our Dealers:\n\n- **Quality**: We want to offer the best to our attendees, so this is important for us.\n- **Variety**: We want to offer a large selection of products made for and within the furry community.\n- **Quantity**:     The weekend has an attendee rate of about 300 guests right now.

All Flüüfff's Policies apply in the Dealers Den.\n\n#### Waiting List\n\nThe Dealers Den waiting list will consist of all the pre-approved dealers selected from initial applications. The applications will be closed 4 weeks prior to the convention. Please apply during this period to be considered for the waiting list.

If this reaction isn't received in time, the dealer will be put to the bottom of the waiting list. In the event they miss the second opening of a table, they will be removed completely.\n#### Cancelation\n\nPlease let us know as soon as possible, if you end up unable to attend the convention.
