## Flüüfff's Dealers' Den Policies \{#dealers-den}

All Policies are subject to change without notice. By applying for space in the Flüüfff Dealers' Den, you agree you have read and understand these policies.

### Registering for the Dealers' Den

Our registration is not a First Come, First Serve kind of deal;

- 3 weeks after the initial Public Registration date we will start making the first sketch for the room; 09.06.2024

- The applications after this process will be sorted in, when possible.

- We strive to send out the acceptance messages towards the dealers a week thereafter; 16.06.2024.

- When the room is full, the dealer will receive an email notification of being on the Waiting list.

Please note, we are volunteers; we strive to complete this phase and communicate it to every Dealer if they are chosen, but this might be delayed.

Our tables are Free; This means it is a free service from the convention towards you, our Dealers, just as it is a service to our attendees.

The registration for a table is done in the initial registration process for becoming an attendee for this edition. This means: You will need to have a valid convention ticket, and thus paid in full, by the time we will make the room sketch.

#### Approval

Once you have been approved you will be sent an email notifying you.

If you were approved, and you didn’t claim your table within 2 weeks, by writing an reply via email, you can [email the Dealers' Den team](mailto:dealers.den@fluufff.org) and request to be placed on the waiting list; you are not directly eligible for a new table.

If you are placed on the waiting list, you will be added to the bottom of the list. If we reach you again, you will have 2 weeks to accept this one via a reply. If you fail to claim that table - you will not be added to the waiting list for that year/edition again.

### What we look for in our Dealers:

_Quality_: We want to offer the best to our attendees, so this is important for us.

_Variety_: We want to offer a large selection of products made for and within the furry community.

_Quantity_: The weekend has an attendee rate of about 300 guests right now. We strive for a Dealers' Den that has a full look.

_Belgian_: We are a Belgian convention, and we want to try to have a certain % of local vendors every year.

Prior experience as a dealer is not necessary.

### General Information

Here you will find the information that is more general, and will mostly stay the same for every year.

#### Table sizes

(Width x Depth cm)

_Artist Alley_: 120 x 45\
_Medium_: 120 x 90\
_Large_: 240 x 90

If not all spots end up being filled - we might contact you for a bigger table size.

#### Hours

The Flüüfff's Dealers' Den will be open to our attendees during the hours listed below, unless otherwise noted. We will make every attempt to communicate changes to dealers, via email, our Dealer Telegram channel, conbook and the information screens during the convention.

Every Regular Hours timeslot ends with the ‘Closing of the doors’ 15 minutes up front, where new attendees will not be let into the Dealers' Den which should provide Dealers with the full hour of Afternoon break.

We will not wait for you to open the doors; It is your responsibility to be ready and on time when the doors open; When you are not able to come to your table, due to illness or any other reason, you are also responsible to arrange someone to take care of your table.

**Opening times and time table will be announced when we are certain.**

#### Convention Ticket

Dealer tables do not come with Convention Tickets. All dealers and their assistants must have purchased a ticket before they can enter the Dealer’s Den. Dealers and assistants will have a marking on or attached to their badge to show they may enter the room during Dealer set-up/closing time. All assistants must be connected to a dealer, and there is a limit of 1 assistant per Dealer.

#### Dealer Room

The Dealers' Den will be secured when not open. The room will be locked and checked regularly.

Do not, under any circumstances, leave cash or other valuables inside of the Dealers' Den that you may need after the den closes. This includes Laptops, MP3 players, or medication. This room will not be opened before the next slot without a good reason.

If it so happens that the room has to be opened - please notify Azana directly on Telegram.

#### Artist Alley

New this year is the artist alley. Unlike most conventions, this is not a first come first serve service, but comes with a registration.

Your table will already have:

- 3 Wire-cubes
- An A4 Plexiglass standee for your price sheet

Ideal for people who take on commissions, have little stock, want to also be able to enjoy their convention or just want to try out being a Dealer.

During the break, or the early opening/closing of the Den, you will get 30 minutes to set up and tear down your table.

Registration also goes via the Registration process.

#### Table Sharing

Tables may be split between 2 individual dealers. However, the second dealer must go through the registration process just as the first dealer. Once approved, when the deadline hasn't passed yet, their information will be added to the conbook.

Each dealer will need to apply, and can request to be seated next to another dealer. Please see ‘Requests’ for more information.

#### Internet

We will not provide a special internet access for our Dealers. You are able to use your own cellular or the open guest Wifi of the hotel.

#### Requests

Flüüfff's will make every attempt to satisfy any and all special requests, but we can’t guarantee anything. If you have a special request, you are urged to contact us as soon as possible. Requests for electricity and wall space will be fulfilled first.

Other requests, such as to sit next to a specific dealer, will be the last to be fulfilled, these requests also need to be submitted by both dealers; So both Dealer A and B have to inform us that they prefer to sit next to each other.

### Display Guidelines & Behavior

Please remember that not everyone may share your tastes, and that your behavior is representative of the entire fandom, just as the event itself.

#### Not Safe for Work (NSFW)

[Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work).

We ask you kindly to put any work that is considered NSFW in a folder and thus not display this openly; for example, art/print dealers we request, where applicable, that two separate binders (‘Clean’, ‘NSFW’) be kept.

If you are unsure if your piece of merchandise is NSFW, please contact the Dealers' Den team on site, or prior via email.

Art or any other depiction of Zoophilia, and Pedophila, Religion, Racism or otherwise will be asked to be put away. Items made from real fur or body parts (taxidermy, skulls) are also forbidden to be sold.

#### Behavior rules

- No space may be transferred without permission from the Dealers' Den head.

- No loud displays will be permitted. We will provide some nice music in the room.

- No pirated works may be sold in the Dealers' Den. Piracy is theft.

- No AI artwork is allowed.

- When selling items or art made by another artist than you as dealer, we ask you to clearly mark items with the info of said artist. We may also ask you for the official paperwork that states that you own the copyrights of these art pieces.

- Free standing displays or stands may not be used in any way that can cause a safety issue or clogs the walkway. If you plan on using anything Outside of your tablespace, please inform the Dealers' Den staff so we can plan this into our table set up.

- No weapons may be sold in the Dealers' Den. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis, but will need to be cleared through the Dealers' Den Head and security.

- No more than 2 people may be behind a single table at any given time.

- Please keep your area clean and take your trash with you, or dispose of it in any of the trash cans provided, when you close up each night.

- Have common decency and respect; don’t steal another Dealer’s customers, and protect one another's goods from theft.

The Dealers' Den Head of Department and their Deputy will have a final say on all disputes in the Den. You can appeal to the Director, but they are likely to decide in favor of the Head. All Flüüfff's Policies apply in the Dealers' Den.

#### Waiting List

The Dealers' Den waiting list will consist of all the pre-approved dealers selected from initial applications. The applications will be closed 4 weeks prior to the convention. Please apply during this period to be considered for the waiting list. In the event of a cancellation, the first person on the list will be contacted to fill the space, and so forth.

**In any case,** be it with first choice Dealers, or people from the waiting list: you will need to accept this table within 4 days with a reply on the email where we inform you. If this reaction isn't received in time, the dealer will be put to the bottom of the waiting list. In the event they miss the second opening of a table, they will be removed completely.

#### Cancelation

Please let us know as soon as possible, if you end up unable to attend the convention. This way we are able to get in contact with dealers from our waiting list quickly, so they can use that time to prepare and plan.

Dealers' Den tables are not transferable to other dealers at the request of the canceling dealer.

Flüüfff is not responsible for upholding promised transfers that violate these Terms of Service.

Please do this via an email. Cancelation via Telegram won’t be accepted as an official means of notification.

Complaints or concerns concerning the Dealers' Den should be addressed to the Dealers' Den Head at [dealers.den@fluufff.org](mailto:dealers.den@fluufff.org).
